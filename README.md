# Sambrit Adhikari Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for the personal portfolio of Sambrit Adhikari! This project showcases Sambrit's professional profile as a program manager and engineer, specializing in AI, machine learning, and software development.

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Background Cycling
- The website features a dynamic background that cycles through a set of images every 10 seconds, providing a visually engaging experience.

### 2. Typewriter Quotes
- Inspirational quotes are displayed with a typewriter animation. Quotes cycle randomly and are refreshed every few seconds.

### 3. Navigation Links
- Quick access to Sambrit's professional links:
  - [Email Sambrit](mailto:sambritadhikari@gmail.com)
  - [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/sambrit)
  - [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sambritadhikari/)

### 4. Interactive Rocket Launch & Easter Egg
- Clicking the "Launch ðŸš€" button triggers an animated rocket or UFO launch, complete with flames and confetti.
- Easter Egg: Clicking the button 5 times rapidly triggers a UFO invasion.

### 5. SEO Optimization
- The site includes meta tags, structured data (JSON-LD), and a canonical URL to enhance search engine visibility.

### 6. Responsive Design
- The layout is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) installed on your machine.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sambrit/portfolio.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the portfolio:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Files and Directories
- **Inline CSS**: The styles for the site are embedded within the `<style>` tag in the HTML file.
- **Scripts**: JavaScript code is included within `<script>` tags for handling interactivity (e.g., rocket launch, background cycling, quotes).
- **Background Images**: Ensure images (`background1.jpg`, `background2.jpg`, etc.) are placed in the same directory as the project.

## How It Works
### Background Cycling
- The JavaScript code switches the background image every 10 seconds, looping through a predefined array of image filenames.

### Typewriter Animation
- Quotes are displayed with a typing effect using a custom `typeQuote` function and cycle through an array of inspirational quotes.

### Rocket and UFO Launch
- The "Launch ðŸš€" button triggers a rocket or UFO launch animation, with flames, sparkles, and confetti effects.
- Clicking the button 5 times rapidly activates the UFO invasion Easter egg.

## Technologies Used
- **CSS3**: Styles for layout, animations, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for interactivity, animations, and background/quote cycling.
